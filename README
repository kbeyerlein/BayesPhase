To run:
python calcSimilarity.py image.Q phases.txt output.npz

Will analyze image.Q using phase info listed in phases.txt file and output to output.npz file.


calcSimilarities.py is a program that 
1. Loads diffraction spot information from a ".Q" file format.
2. Removes Spots that have Qr similar to Si-I phase
3. Loads precalculated database of Bragg spot info for phases
4. Calculates similarity score of each spot Qr compared to given phase.
5. Calculates similarity score of each spot with spot neighbors (2-point similarity) compared to a given phase.
6. Outputs npz file with Qr Similarity scores, Best Qr HKL assignment and 2-point similariy scores
